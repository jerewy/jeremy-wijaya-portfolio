## Project Structure

```text
app/
  components/
    animated-background.tsx  # Canvas particle network with requestAnimationFrame cleanup
    custom-cursor.tsx        # Pointer-following glow cursor with class-based cursor fallback
    hero-scene.tsx           # @react-three/fiber robot that looks toward the visitor
    skill-slider.tsx         # Continuous marquee for hard skills with direction controls
  globals.css                # Tailwind layers, scroll behaviour, marquee keyframes
  layout.tsx                 # Root layout and font wiring
  page.tsx                   # Portfolio content, sections, and data arrays
components/ui/               # Reusable button, card, badge primitives
lib/utils.ts                 # `cn` helper for conditional Tailwind classes
```

## Customising Content

- **Hero copy & stats** â€“ Update hero text, stats, project listings, and contact links directly inside `app/page.tsx`.
- **Skills** â€“ Add or remove entries in the `hardSkillSlides`, `quickSkills`, and `softSkills` arrays.
- **Assets** â€“ Place images in `public/` and reference them from the `projects` array for automatic optimisation via `next/image`.
- **Cursor appearance** â€“ Tweak colours, shadows, and animation speeds inside `app/components/custom-cursor.tsx`. The cursor only hides the native pointer while `isVisible` is true.

## Accessibility Notes

- The animated background stops its `requestAnimationFrame` loop when the component unmounts to avoid background CPU usage.
- The custom cursor toggles an `html.cursor-hidden` class so the system cursor remains available if JavaScript fails or visitors disable effects.
- Section headings use semantic HTML and responsive typography for legibility across devices.
